Day 52: Implementation of training loop and image synthesis in CUDA

1) Summary of the daily tutorial

The code implements a simple one‑step training loop for a two‑layer convolutional “denoiser” network and then using it to synthesize images via a reverse‑diffusion process. The workflow is:

- Training pass on a single mini‑batch:  
  - Forward propagate a noisy image through two 3×3 convolution layers (with ReLU and a residual connection)  
  - Compute mean‑squared error (MSE) loss against a Gaussian noise target  
  - Backpropagate gradients through convolutions and update weights with SGD  
- Image synthesis (reverse diffusion):  
  Starting from pure Gaussian noise, iterate \(T\) reverse steps of the form  

  ```math
  x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_t}}\Bigl(x_t - \frac{\beta_t}{\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}}\,\epsilon_\theta(x_t,t)\Bigr) + \sigma_t\,z,\quad z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)
  ```

  where epsilon_theta the network’s prediction of noise at timestep t, and follows a linear schedule.

- CUDA kernels:

  - conv3_fwd: A 3×3 forward convolution with TILE+2 x TILE+2 shared‑memory tiling; processes one block per output channel and spatial tile.  

  - relu_fwd / relu_bwd: Applies ReLU activation (and its gradient) element‑wise over a flat tensor.  

  - add_kernel: Implements the residual connection by adding two tensors element‑wise.  

  - zero_kernel: Zeros out a gradient buffer before accumulation.  

  - conv3_bwd_data: Computes gradients with respect to the convolution inputs by sliding the flipped kernel over the output gradients.  

  - conv3_bwd_w: Accumulates weight gradients for each kernel index via atomic adds across the batch.  

  - sgd: Performs an in‑place SGD update:  

    ```math
    w_i \leftarrow w_i - \mathrm{lr}\,\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_i}
    ```

  - loss_mse_grad: Computes MSE loss and its gradient in one kernel:  

    ```math
    L = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i (y_i - t_i)^2,\quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_i}=\frac{2}{N}(y_i - t_i)
    ```

  - rng_init: Initializes a Philox RNG state per pixel for use in the diffusion sampler.  

  - reverse_step_kernel: Executes one reverse‑diffusion step on the latent \(x_t\), sampling a fresh Gaussian `z` and applying the update formula above.
